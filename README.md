# Introduction

A comprehensive guide to automating deployment and lifecycle management of a MERN Stack application on AWS using modern DevOps practices and tools.

---

# Project Overview

The project implements a fully automated environment for deploying and managing a three-tier application using:

- Infrastructure automation with Terraform
- CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins and ArgoCD
- Monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana
- Secure hosting on AWS EKS
- Custom domain configuration with Route 53

---

# Core Components

- **Infrastructure**: AWS EKS, VPC, EC2 instances
- **CI/CD**: Jenkins, ArgoCD
- **Security**: SonarQube, Trivy, OWASP
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana
- **Container Registry**: Amazon ECR
- **DNS Management**: Route 53, ACM

# Implementation Steps

## 1. Initial Setup

- Create IAM user with appropriate permissions
- Launch control EC2 instance for Jenkins
- Install required tools (Jenkins, Docker, Terraform)

## 2. Infrastructure Provisioning

- Configure Jenkins for infrastructure deployment
- Create EKS cluster using Terraform
- Set up jump server for cluster access

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

- Configure Jenkins pipelines for frontend and backend
- Integrate SonarQube for code quality analysis
- Set up ECR repositories
- Configure ArgoCD for GitOps deployment

## 4. Security Implementation

- Implement code scanning with SonarQube
- Configure Trivy for container scanning
- Set up OWASP dependency checks
- Secure cluster access through jump server

## 5. Monitoring Setup

- Deploy Prometheus for metrics collection
- Configure Grafana dashboards
- Set up alerting and monitoring
- Implement logging solutions

## 6. Domain Configuration

- Purchase and configure custom domain
- Set up Route 53 for DNS management
- Configure SSL certificates through ACM
- Implement ingress controllers
